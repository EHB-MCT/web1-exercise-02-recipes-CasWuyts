		<h2>Ingredienten</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>3 lbs russet potatoes scrubbed but not peeled</li>
			<li>peanut oil for frying</li>
			<li>
				2 bone-in rib eye steaks each about 1½ inches thick, at room temperature
			</li>
			<li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
			<li>2 thyme sprigs</li>
			<li>2 rosemary sprigs</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Bereiding</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Cut the potatoes into ¼-inch-thick batons and place in a large bowl of
				cold water. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Line a large baking sheet with paper
				towel and set a wire rack on top.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a large Dutch oven or high-sided, heavy-bottomed pot, pour the peanut
				oil to a depth of 3 inches. Heat over medium heat until it reaches 325°F
				on a deep-frying thermometer. Drain the potatoes and pat completely dry
				with paper towel.
			</li>
			<li>
				Working in batches, fry the potatoes for 5 to 6 minutes, turning them
				every minute or so. The fries will be lightly colored at this point.
				Transfer the partially cooked fries to the wire rack while you carry on
				frying the remaining batches; do not discard the oil (you’ll need it
				again later). Let rest on the wire rack while you make your steak.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and get it as hot
				as the sun. Open any kitchen windows and turn on your hood fan (trust
				me).
			</li>
			<li>
				Brush all sides of each steak with olive oil and season well with salt
				and pepper. Remember, you can’t season the inside of the steak, so go
				extra generous on the outside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place your steaks in the skillet and immediately set a timer. Every
				minute on the minute, flip the steaks. At the 7-minute mark, add the
				butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to the skillet. Continue cooking,
				constantly basting the steaks with garlicky herb butter and flipping
				every minute, until a digital thermometer inserted in the thickest part
				of the steaks reaches 130°F (perfect for medium-rare, as the internal
				temperature of the steaks will continue increasing as they rest).
				Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 7 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				While your steak rests, finish frying your fries and make your whisky
				peppercorn sauce. Heat the oil until it reaches 375°F on a deep-frying
				thermometer. Working in batches, cook the fries again for 2 to 4
				minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Drain on the wire rack, and
				generously season with salt. Let the oil return to 375°F before each
				batch.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat the peppercorns in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast
				for 2 minutes. Add 2 tbsp of the butter, shallots, garlic and a pinch of
				salt, and cook, stirring often, until the shallots are softened, 3 to 4
				minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the whisky. Return the
				skillet to the heat and allow flame to burn off the alcohol, about 1
				minute (you can use your trusty barbecue lighter to light a flame here –
				just be very careful, please).
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the cream, stock, any juices that have come out of the resting
				steaks and lemon zest and bring to a boil. Let the sauce cook until
				thickened, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the remaining 2 tbsp
				of butter and season to taste with salt.
			</li>
			<li>
				Slice the steaks against the grain into thin slices. Divide among four
				plates and spoon some of the sauce over. Serve with a pile of fries
				alongside.
			</li>
		</ol>
